# How Predictive Modelers Should Use Data to Tell Data Stories

## Dean Abbott - Co-Founder and Cheif Data Scientist - SmarterHQ

## Key Takeaways

  - know your software vis building blocks
  - every vis is biased
      + be transparent about bias
      + different biases reveal complementary aspects of the data story
  - Know your audience
      + tell a story that the heaeres understand

## Rough Outline of Talk

Kaiser Fung

Visualization on a matrix of Low-High Effort (x axis) vs. Low-High Reward (y axis)

Different types of descisions
 
  - Strategic (low frequency)
  - Tactical (medium frequency)
  - Operational (high frequency and high impact)

Principles

  - Know what you're working with
      + visualization types
  - Pie charts aren't just bad because they're bad, they're also frequently misused
      + Poor visual communication
          * examples of charts where it's nearly impossible to have key takeaways

No free lunches when tranforming the data to make visual communication clearer (zooming, log-scaling)

Showed example of a somewhat complex plot which contained all of the information from the analysis, but wasn't understood by stakeholders. Used a decision tree with discrete and easy-to-understand and actionable rules.
