## Day 1

Most of the sessions I attended on day 1 had something to do with operationalizing analytics or delivering business value with analytics. All of the speakers related to this topic admitted how hard it is to make analytics _actionable_ and _acted on_. 

Probably the most important idea that was repeated in a few different talks was about getting business users to talk openly about the problem they are trying to solve. Rather than trying to run with a problem described as "tell us some insights about X", analysts should engage with the stakeholder to understand what part of their decision-making process they're trying to improve. 

This relates to a concept describe as the "data-first fallacy":

  - Issues with the "data-first" fallacy
      + "data first" - data scientists drive decisions in modeling / analytics project
      + Results in interesting model, but not models that will add business value
      + Make sure the analytic will be actionable __before you build it__

The successful implementation of an analytical project usually involved:

  - Buy-in from stakeholders
  - Collaboration with others outside of the data team
  - Starting with a business-decision in mind
      + Succesful projects _usually_ did not start with trying to analyze a question framed as "what are some insights about X"
      + Successful projects would start with understanding some decision business users make frequently, and trying to pinpoint factors leading to that decision that could be automated / optimized / improved through analytics
  - Framing the solution in terms of business value
      + Rather than evaluating a model based on statistics (fit, errors, etc), it _should_ be evaluated and messaged in terms of the value it produces
          * These value statements can be generated using simulations or expermeints

There was also a brief discussion in one of the talks about the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science. Sometimes these conversations devolve into something useless, but I found the speaker's opinion to be productive. 

Analytics

__output__: insights
__goal__: inform the actor
__focus__: the "what", what can we learn about X?
__positioned__: in trenches with senior leadership, advising strategy and tactics

Data Science

__output__: decisions
__goal__: be the actor
__focus__: the "how", how can we learn to do X?
__positioned__: still solicit feedback from senior leadership, but exists with a bit more distance from them
