# Steps to Overcome the Greatest Challenges to Analytics Deployment

## Marco Vriens - Kwantum Analytics

_Got to this session a bit late, previous session went long._

## Key Takeaways

  - What makes an analytical project successful?
      + A lot of work needs to be done _after_ the model has been built
  - How to approach a project acting as a consultant
      + What is the decision we are trying to change / improve?
  - Another talk highlighting collaboration, starting a project with the decision in mind, and demonstrating the distinct business value of a project

## Talk Outline

Selecting an analytical target

  - market dynamics
      + where is the market going?
  - market share dynamics
      + if market is stagnant, how to increase share?
          * how can I win market share - what levers should I pull?
              - discrete choice modeling
          * which customers are most likely loyal at risk or switchable?
  - marketing dynamics
      + marketing mix modeling
      + which marketing activities are working and which are not?
          * experimentation can be used after statistical results are presented
  - customer dynamics

Best way to use / implement analytics: start with a decision in mind

  - Can do analysis and insights, but without looking at a decision, hard to deploy

What do successful analytical projects have in common?

> Trust, partnership with senior leadership, advanced analytics, multiple steps, validation (experimentation, simulation, results can be trusted)

  - Advanced analytics
  - From modeling results to so-what (simulation & experimentation)
  - Performed over multiple steps
  - Integration across multiple datasets
  - Validation: results can be trusted
  - Partnership with stakeholders
  - CEO driven
  - Deepenining of insights
  - Decision support system: recommendation engine
  - Importance of process that was being augmented / improved
  - Transportability

Questions to ask after analytical project has been "completed"

  - Do decision makers know about the insights?
  - Do they understand the insights?
  - Are the insights: credible, actionable, accepted?
  - Are the insights acted on and acted on correctly?

Management of Analytics 

  - Training
      + of analytics team __and__ stakeholders
  - Decision support systems
  - Analytics portal and insights search engine
      + Make the results of analytical efforts accessible to the organization
