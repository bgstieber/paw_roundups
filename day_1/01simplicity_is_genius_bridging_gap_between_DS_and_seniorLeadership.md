# Simplicity is Genius: Bridging the Gap between Data Scientists and Senior Leadership

## James Carson - Team Leader, Quicken Loans

_He went kind of quikly through these slides. I hope these are made available._

## Key Takeaways

  - A lot of this talk was about communication of results and how to get buy-in from senior leaderships and allowing data science teams to do what they do best
      + This was the second talk that emphasized how models should be explained without confusing / scaring a business user
          * I think we're getting a lot better at this!
  - How do we get business users comfortable with allowing machines/algorithms/data science to make decisions?
      + Show impact in terms business owners can understand
  - Also discussed analytics / data science divide
      + First time I've heard a productive discussion of why this divide matters
          * Divide is important when thinking about where each group should be positioned within an organization
      + Analytics: inform the actor, Data Science: be the actor
  - Humans should still be involved in the vision of an organization
      + Senior leadership should not be solutioning
  - A vision for data science should be a vision for your business itself
      + don't need a vision for ML/AI

## Rough Outline of Talk

Data scientists don't know how to talk to senior leadership

Data science takes decision making away from senior leadership

Analytics - telling the story
    output: insights
    goal: inform the actor
    focus: the "what"
    what can we learn about X?
    positioned: in trenches with senior leadership, advising strategy and tactics

Data Science
    output: decisions
    goal: be the actor
    focus: the "how"
    how can we learn to do X?
    positioned: still solicit feedback from senior leadership, but exists with a bit more distance from them

Explaining your model: give high-level summaries relevant to business users

Focus on evaluation criteria:

  - what does accuracy mean? 
  - what's the value of getting it right?
      + what's the risk if we got it wrong?

Why did you solve the problem this way?
    - Problem often dictates the solution

No fancy jargon
    - clearly state: expected value, effort and deadline, assumptions you're making, hypothesis you're testing
