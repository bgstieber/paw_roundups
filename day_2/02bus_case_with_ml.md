# Making a Business Case with Machine Learning 

## Bob Bress - VP of Analytics - Freewheel

## Key Takeaways

  - quantify impact of ML implementation in compelling way
  - understand how ML implementation changes business processes and have a change management plan
  - anticipate maintenance and costs (both with _and_ without the ML implementation)
  - build incrementally and to meet customers' needs
      + start simple with proof-of-concept phase
      + show incremental benefit of ML solution
  - understand data requirements and tech to support it
  - identify a champion to push for implementation

## Rough Outline of Talk 

Going from concept to productionalizing. Need to make business case for automating a decision-making process.

Questions to ask for ML (considerations for developing a business case for implementing/developing an ML solution)

  - What problem does it solve?
      + Interesting model can be useless without a business application
  - Is the key data available?
      + What are data systems like?
      + Is this data available across the business, or just for a select
  - Can we quantify the benefits?
      + What are the critical metrics
          * How is success measured?
      + Measure a baseline (decision-making process without the ML solution)
  - Who is the customer?
      + Keep work on proof-of-concept as simple as possible
  - How good is "good enough"?
      + incremental development (i.e. improvement) should be worth the analyst / business effort
  - What are the operational impacts?
      + change management
  - How will it be maintained?
      + System performance, data quality, model updating/refreshing
  - What are the costs (without ML vs. with ML)
  - What is the demand for this solution?
  
Know risks and have a plan

  - Will ML be critical to the business and need to be ready in real time
  - How will business be impacted if ML goes down or is rendered unusable
  - How good is the data (quality, storage, and supply)
  - What business scenarios require manual intervention
      + When will we need a human-in-the-loop
