# Delivering the Business Value of Analytics 

## CEO Decision Managment Solutions - James Taylor

## Key Takeaways

  - Looked at what barriers exist in deploying an analytic solution (how to make analytics actionable __and__ acted on)
      + Why do these barriers exist? What are these barriers?
      + How do we combat these barriers? Workaround these barriers?
  - Analytic teams are done when the business changes its decision-making in a way that creates business value __and not before__
  - What is involved in implementing an "analytic"?
      + Case for more time being spent on building decision/business understanding
      + Use a decision model to mix and match technologies _within_ the larger set of analytic technologies 
  - Issues with the "data-first" fallacy
      + "data first" - data scientists drive decisions in modeling / analytics project
      + Results in interesting model, but not models that will add business value
      + Make sure the analytic will be actionable __before you build it__
  - How?
      + Decisions first
      + Let the experts speak
          * Ask the question "how do you do your day job now?" and follow up with many "why" questions
              - __Do not start__ with "what do you want analytics to do"
          * making changes to existing business practices is hard, need to understand what can / should be augmented by an analytic
      + Adopt business rules
      + Analytics don't stand alone 
          * projects should start with a diverse group of individuals from different units in the business in a room to discuss
      + Change the business
          * Incremental improvement to some standard decision-making process


## Rough Outline of Talk

(slides available as pdf)

Delivering business value - how?
    make products __cheaper__, __better__, __sooner__, __more satisfying__

Why don't some analytics projects not add business value?
    not actionable: solves wrong problem, too hard to use, too expensive
    not actioned: not integrated, not believed, not used

Barriers to "actionizing" analytics are widespread

Key problem: can't implement in workflow of front-line workforce

Valuable analytic - ....

How to use actionable analytics in front line (building valuable analytics)

  - build it
      + addresses a problem or opportunity
          * can be used, is believed, embedded in systems
          * if analytics does not lead to more informed decisions and more effective actions, then why do it at all?

Critical success factors

  1. adopt a business-decision-centric approach
  2. change how you deine business understanding
  3. consider decision makin technologies as a set of technologies, not standalone

Business-centric approach (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining CRISPDM)

  - Put __business understanding and business problem__ first
      + what is business value? __need to have this defined__
  - Evaluate the model (not in statistical terms, but in terms of __business impact__) 
  - Deploy
  - Repeat 

Put decisions first for business understanding (__requires input from the business__)
  
  - What business measures?
  - What decisions have an impact?
      + What can / do we want to change?
  - Which decision should we improve?
  - What does improve mean?

Make the project about the decision, not the analytics

Analyzing a decision - __decision understanding__
  
  1. Decision (specific questions and allowed answers)
  2. Data
  3. Sub-decisions
  4. Knowledge

Business (people) Understanding

  - Let experts speak
      + Naive data scientist: "why do I need to talk to the people, when I have the data?"
          * Front-line people are the ones implementing the analytic, analytic needs to match (match? augment? improve?) their decision-making processes (i.e. how they work)
  - Model the decision
  - Let experts frame the problem
      + What do they want?

Mix and match decision-making technology

  - Most decisions need more than just predictions
      + Big scope and large set of technologies (descriptive analysis, maching learning, predictive analytics)

Digital Decisioning

  - Culture of digital decisions-first design thinking
  - Nexus of business rules, data, analytics, and machine learning models
  - __One__ smarter, automated decision can be worth millions in terms of customer acquisition retention and/or operational efficiency

Analytic teams are done when the business changes its decision-making in a way that creates business value __and not before__
