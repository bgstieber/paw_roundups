      + How should projects be prioritized?
          * Upper-level decision makers across the business should be involved in the prioritizing of analytics projects

## Rough Outline of Talk

  - Get buy-in of analytic technologies
      + took 3.5 years to implement _first_ predictive model at Northwestern Mutual
      + Struggled to find the _right_ business users to push the analytical models through the enterprise
      + Need to get agreement throughout the enterprise
          * Prioritizing projects that can leverage analytics
  - Run the development
      + What didn't work: two person team of data engineers and data scientist
      + What did work: more diverse group of people working on different facets of a problem (data engineers, data scientists, project managers, engagement professionals, business subject experts)
          * Hard stop if business couldn't devote at least one subject expert on project
  - Take small steps
      + __don't try to do it all at once__
      + Break the problem into little pieces
      + Not everything needs to be solved right away!
  - Prove it
      + Experimentation and measurement helps get business leaders to accept it, want it, and change for it
      + Think carefully about design of experiments
  - Go with the flow, while going against it
      + Analytics and data science has reputation of "black magic"
          * Demystify these techniques by showing how small parts of the business can be changed with understandable methodologies
  - Persevere
      + It's going to take a while!
