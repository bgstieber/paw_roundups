# Operationalizing Machine Learning: How to Ensure Value-Driven Deployment

## Key Takeaways from Panel

Conflicts between development and deployment of models

  - technical skills 
  - speed vs. accuracy

How do you accelerate the modeling process?

How do you grow the analytical process (move away from ad hoc) to face bigger challenges.

"Operationalization"

Barriers to deployment

  1. wasn't built with customer in mind
     - who are this model's users?
  2. not scalable
  3. no user acquistion or retention plan
     - no users = no value
  4. no integration into business process
     - turn analytics solution into business process
     - CRISPDM

Stop building solutions without users in mind. 

Do:

  - Leverage domain expertise
      + when to involve a human
      + input on building model
  - focus on business problem
  - Integrated data supply chain
      + Make it easy to get the data needed to re-train the model 
      + not a one-time exercise

Don't

  - Don't forget about deployment
  - Don't discuss algorithms when presenting results of the model
      + focus on impact not algorithm
  - Don't believe in out-of-the box AI or machine learning
      + It takes time to go through the modelling process
      + Can't turn on instantly

Where to start at an immature analytics organization

  - Current state analysis
      + what already exists
      + get vision from executives and operating managers
      + how are we trying to change business levels
  - Make sure an infrastructure is available for what modeling/machine learning involves
  - What are the measures of success
      + Value drivers in organization
      + Make sure framework for proofs of concept is in place
      + solid communication plan in place
  - Get proof-of-concepts ready to ship early and often
      + "Agile" framework
          * not _actually_ agile, but focused on a lot of deliverables along the way
  - Solve a problem further down the organization
      + change isn't going to (initially) come at executive level

Data governance and management

  - Agile POCs are to test if a concept will work, is it going to help the business?
  - If data governance is not in place, models will fail
      + Version control, integrated data supply chain
  - Can still improve business processes with poor quality data
      + __A 60-40 model beats a 50-50 coin flip, even on crappy data__

Definition of operationalization

  - Impacts a business decision
      + You're able to use the ML model to change a business decision
      + "It depends" for technical operationalizng a model
  - Do research on users and what their processes are to ensure what has been built will actually be used
      + Measure user acceptance in a few different ways

Thinking about the implementation of a model should follow through the entire development lifecycle. Operationalization should not be a surprise.

Measure success of a model by how it's improved KPIs.

What has caused failures for businesses to deploy analytics?

  - Lack of belief in analytics
  - Organizations set up huge and great IT infrastructure, but no idea of how it will be used, or what success will look like
  - Change management
      + complacency and skepticism
      + Need to have a solid change management plan in place

Strategies for growing and scaling analytics team at an organization

  - What processes are needed to ensure that resources are still allocated efficiently
      + Knowledge management and documentation
          * Not just good code documentation, but documenting results and findings from the project
          * are you allowing next person working on the model to understand what was done
      + Learn by observation and not by experience
  - Invest in talent development, have a strategy around training
  
How to choose between building internally vs building externally

  - Focus on core competencies
  - Scalability
  - Buy vs. build
      + Does capability exist internally?
      + Competitive differentiator
          * Need to hold close to the chest?
      + Cost and ROI?
